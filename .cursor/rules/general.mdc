# Coding Style Guide

## 1. Naming Conventions

- **Always use `snake_case`** for variables and functions.
- **Use ALL_CAPS** for constants.
- ✅ `max_value`, `process_data`, `MAX_RETRIES`
- ❌ `maxValue`, `processData`, `MaxRetries`

---

## 2. Code Principles

- Follow **SOLID principles** and **Clean Code** practices.
- Keep things **balanced** — avoid over-engineering or adding unnecessary abstractions.
- Example:
  - **Good:** One class per responsibility, small functions, meaningful names.
  - **Bad:** Excessive layers or factories for simple tasks.

## 3. Collaboration Rule

- **Always ask me before making any code changes.**
- Applies to:
  - Renaming variables
  - Restructuring methods/classes
  - Modifying existing logic
  - creating new files
- Treat this as a _confirmation checkpoint_ before proceeding.

## 4. General Mindset

- Write code as if the next person to maintain it will be **an exhausted version of yourself**.
- Keep clarity over cleverness.
- Document intent when it’s not obvious.
